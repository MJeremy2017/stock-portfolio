# Identify Undervalued Stocks

This competition aims to identify undervalued stocks and evaluate their investment return in 1-2 year time.

## Data

To get the training data, start a new notebook and use the `make_data` function in the `utils.py` file. 
This returns `train`, and `val` set. Note that `test` set will also be created along the way it is hidden 
from the contestants and is used for final evaluation only.

Along the way, `df_ohlc` which contains all the prices of all `S&P500` stocks will also be returned for your training,
however contestants are optional to use this data.

```
from utils import make_data

train, val, df_ohlc = make_data()
```

## Evaluation

Your task is to build a model to **RANK the TOP 30 stocks** given the data above **at each year with Q1 data**. 
Your result is evaluated by the average return in 1-year and 2-year period as well as the standard deviation over the
evaluation period.

To evaluate your model, your model must 

1. Implement the `Model` interface in the `utils.py`.
2. Use the `Evaluator` in the `utils.py`.

A quick example

```
from utils import Evaluator, Model

class MM(Model):
    def preprocess(self, data):
        """
        Put feature engineering here, the data set shares the same format as `val` from `make_data()`. 
        """
        return data
    
    def predict(self, data):
        """
        The returned data frame must contain a column `symbol` with sorted stocks. Only the top 30 stocks will
        be picked in the evaluation. 
        """
        return pd.DataFrame({'symbol': ['AAPL', 'AAL']})


model = MM()
e = Evaluator(model)
metric, bd_yr = e.evaluate()

print(metric, bd_yr)
```

A more formal example please refer to the [heuristic-example.ipynb](./heuristic-example.ipynb).

### Important Note

1. During the evaluation, each stock's Q1 data per year will be fed to your model, and the buy-in time is taken on the
first Monday and 30 days after the `date` of the report. The rationale is that if a Q1 financial report has a
`date = {year}-03-31`, the
result is normally released on 30 days after that `date`. Taking the first Monday after that is the first date that the stock
can be trade.


## Some Ideas

Here are some ideas to build a strong portfolio.

1. Number of Stocks and Sector Focus:
	- A well-diversified portfolio typically contains 20-30 stocks to reduce unsystematic risk without diluting potential returns through over-diversification.
	- Sectors to focus on include Technology (for innovation and growth), Healthcare (for stability and long-term demographic trends), Consumer Discretionary (for market trends and consumer behavior), and Green Energy (for future sustainability trends).
2. Determining Undervalued and Strong Growth Stocks:
	- Fundamental Analysis: Look for low Price-to-Earnings (P/E) and Price-to-Book (P/B) ratios compared to industry averages, strong return on equity (ROE), consistent revenue and earnings growth, and healthy debt-to-equity ratios.
	- Growth Potential: Evaluate the companyâ€™s market position, product pipeline, R&D investments, and potential for expansion in emerging markets.
3. Prioritizing Long-Term Growth Prospects:
	- Identify companies with sustainable competitive advantages (like strong brand, proprietary technology, or market dominance).
	- Focus on sectors with long-term tailwinds, like technological advancements (e.g., AI, 5G) and demographic shifts (e.g., aging populations requiring more healthcare services).
4. Quantitative and Data Science Analysis for Stock Selection:
	- Statistical Analysis: Use regression models to predict earnings growth and analyze historical price trends.
	- Machine Learning: Apply algorithms to identify patterns in stock price movements, considering variables like volume, price variability, and market sentiment.
	- Sentiment Analysis: Analyze news, social media, and financial reports to gauge market sentiment towards a stock.
	- Risk Management: Employ portfolio optimization techniques, like Monte Carlo simulations, to understand risk-return profiles.
5. Timing Buy and Sell Decisions:
	- Technical Analysis: Use indicators like moving averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands to identify entry and exit points.
	- Economic Indicators: Monitor macroeconomic indicators like interest rates, inflation, GDP growth, and unemployment rates to understand the market cycle and its potential impact on stocks.
	- Event-Driven Strategies: Be vigilant about corporate events such as earnings announcements, mergers and acquisitions, or regulatory changes that can affect stock prices.
